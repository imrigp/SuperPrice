# Prices

Parse and store Israeli supermarket chain stores' prices.  
The law obligates all large supermarket chains to publish the price (including promos) of every item in each of their stores.  
Although there is a uniform format they should follow, they don't fully comply it it so measures need to be taken in order to collect the data uniformly.  
Furthermore, each chain publishes the data on their own website, which requires special parsing for every chain.
